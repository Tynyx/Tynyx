<p>I have been working with IT since i left the military in 2015 so at least 10 years after and i dabbled with hardware and software components since i was in hight school. I was actually introduced to the software engineering side of things because my better who has blessed with my son actually convinced me to go back to school and a get a degree while i was working a dead end security job and now i can say i am actually a junior at Valencia College with few semesters left before i obtain my bachelors in Computing Technology and Software Development. </p>
