I have been working with IT since i left the military in 2015 so at least 10 years after and i dabbled with hardware and software components since i was in hight school. I was actually introduced to the software engineering side of things because my better who has blessed with my son actually convinced me to go back to school and a get a degree while i was working a dead end security job and now i can say i am actually a junior at Valencia College with few semesters left before i obtain my bachelors in Computing Technology and Software Development. 

I am here looking for my liked minded people who would like to connect and become advanced software engineers. 
I do already have my A.S. in Comp Info Tech.
I have worked in the IT field for the past decade and gained alot of experience and know how from my jobs
I have completed the 19- week bootcamp course for software engineers offered by HackReactor and have the cert as proof.
Currently trying to obtain more skills from software engineerng to have a remote position so i can travel and live with my family in uruguay
